### 🔋 Homework 5 – Energy-Based Models, JEM++, DVAEs & GANs  
Explore advanced generative modeling paradigms through deep energy formulations, discrete representations, and adversarial training:

- ⚡ **Energy-Based Models (EBMs)** – Train scalar-valued networks `E(x)` and `E(x, y)` using Stochastic Langevin Dynamics and contrastive divergence. Compare unconditional and class-conditional sampling on CIFAR-10 and MNIST.  
- 🔁 **Replay Buffer & Noise Scheduling** – Investigate initialization strategies (random vs. replay buffer) and noise annealing using exponential schedules.  
- 🔐 **JEM & JEM++** – Turn a classifier into a joint energy model. Use a mix of cross-entropy and generative losses with SGLD. JEM++ adds GMM-based initialization and Proximal SGLD for improved sampling stability.  
- 🔢 **Discrete Variational Autoencoders (DVAEs)** – Quantize latent space using vector quantization, apply KMeans clustering, and analyze using silhouette scores, confusion matrices, and t-SNE plots.  
- 🇮🇷 **GANs for Persian Digits** – Train and compare vanilla GAN and Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) on binary Persian digits. Assess image quality, loss convergence, and sample fidelity.

Each section is implemented using PyTorch and includes visualizations, quantitative evaluations, and reproducible experiment code.
