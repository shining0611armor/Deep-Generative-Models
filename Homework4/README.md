# 🔄 Normalizing Flows & Latent Space Manipulation  

This repository contains **Homework 4** for the graduate-level course **Deep Generative Models**, taught by Dr. B. Nasihatkon at **K. N. Toosi University of Technology** during **Spring 1404 (2025)**.

The course is designed for both **Master’s and PhD** students and covers advanced topics in generative modeling using modern deep learning frameworks.

This homework includes two main coding practices:

- 🎨 **Image Generation with Normalizing Flows**  
  Explore the GLOW model to manipulate and generate facial images via latent space transformations such as noise injection, attribute transfer, and embedding fusion.

- 🌀 **Denoising 3D Point Clouds in Latent Space**  
  Apply embedding-space denoising techniques to corrupted point cloud data (ModelNet-40C) and analyze their effects on reconstruction quality.

> 🛠️ Implemented entirely in **PyTorch** with a focus on clarity, experimentation, and reproducibility.
