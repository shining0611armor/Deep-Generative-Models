📦 **Homework Designed By:** Mehran Tamjidi *(Head Teaching Assistant)*


This repository contains **Homework 3** for the graduate-level course **Deep Generative Models**, taught by Dr. B. Nasihatkon at **K. N. Toosi University of Technology** during **Spring 1404 (2025)**.

The assignment includes both theoretical and practical components, centered around two major topics:

- 📐 **Variational Inference in Bayesian Networks**  
  Derive the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) for a fully factorized variational posterior on a latent-variable Bayes Net with real-valued observations.

- 🧮 **Autoregressive Modeling of Persian Digits with Image GPT**  
  Implement a lightweight version of Image GPT to generate binary images of Persian digits (0–9) using autoregressive modeling, with a focus on low-resource settings and efficient sampling.

> 🛠️ All implementations are done in **PyTorch**, with an emphasis on interpretability and performance under limited computational constraints.
