This repository contains **Homework 2** for the graduate-level course **Deep Generative Models**, taught by Dr. B. Nasihatkon at **K. N. Toosi University of Technology** during **Spring 1404 (2025)**.

The assignment focuses on implementing a generative model using Bayesian Networks to generate binary images of Persian digits (0–9), covering:

- 🖼️ **Data Preparation**  
  Utilizing a provided dataset of binary Persian digit images with black backgrounds and white foreground digits.

- 🕸️ **Model Implementation**  
  Constructing Bayesian Networks where each pixel is a node connected to its parent pixels (above, left, and top-left).  
  Experimenting with 3-connected, 8-connected, and 15-connected graphs to analyze performance differences.

- 📊 **Conditional Probability Distributions (CPDs)**  
  Modeling each pixel’s CPD using a first-order linear sigmoid model with shared parameters

> 🛠️ Deliverables include well-documented Python code and generated digit samples under various experimental conditions.
